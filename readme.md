# Amatino Mac
Amatino Mac is a first-party GUI application for accounting in Apple's macOS. It is under construction and not yet ready for any use by anyone!

Under the hood, Amatino Mac uses the [Amatino Swift](https://github.com/amatino-code/amatino-swift) client library to interact with the Amatino API. Developers building applications with Amatino Swift might find useful examples of implementing accounting activities inside Amatino Mac.
